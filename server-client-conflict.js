In Next.js 15, a rather uncommon issue arises when using the `app` directory structure alongside server components and client components that rely on shared modules or contexts.  If a server component imports a module that subsequently imports a client component (or a module that depends on a client component), you might encounter unexpected behavior or runtime errors. This is because server components operate in a different environment than client components, and trying to access client-side-only functionality within a server component will lead to problems.
