The solution is to refactor your code to eliminate any dependency paths from server components to client components.  This usually involves creating separate modules for server-side and client-side logic, ensuring each component only imports the necessary modules for its specific environment.  For example, instead of having a shared module that relies on client components, create two variants: one specifically for the server and one for the client.  Any shared logic can be abstracted into smaller, independent, environment-agnostic modules.
